# Notebook \#6
Using CNNs to predict whether a chest x-ray has pneumonia. 

## The Data: ðŸ“Š

For this notebook, you will train a convolutional neural network for an image recognition task (like the cat vs. dog example). In this case, your algorithm will utilize a dataset of chest x-ray images to help learn how to diagnose pneumonia OR Simpsons data to identify a Simpsons character. The assignment is inspired by the Kaggle data competition  https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset

## The Exercises: ðŸ’ª
The assignment is to run an experiment where you try a basic CNN network and then try a variation on it to see what happens. I will be looking for the following:

1. In a mark-down cell near the top of your notebook, give a brief explanation of your problem.  
2. Build a **baseline CNN** that has incorporates convolution layers and pooling layers. Something like this:
  - Conv layer 1
  - Pool layer 1
  - Conv layer 2
  - Pool layer 2
  - Flatten
  - Fully Connected (Dense)

3. Build a **tuned CNN**--simply a CNN that has some changes from the first one. You may change whichever parameters you like (consider the kernel size, the number of layers, the types of layer, the number of feature maps in each layer, adding dropout layers, etc). Just make some sort of change that you think might be significant, train you new model, and compare its performance to the original. In a text-cell, describe what you changed.   
    - You should train each model for enough epochs that your performance on the test set stops improving (i.e., show where you reach overfitting)  OR for at least 30 minutes of training time. If you would like to further experiment with additional changes, that is fine, but because these things sometimes take a long time to train, I'm setting a low bar for just showing me two variations.

4. **Include graphs** of how well your testing data performed vs. the training data.

5. **Conclusions**: *Thoroughly* answer the following questions in a markup cell at the bottom of your notebook.
    - What configuration of your CNN proved to be more accurate? Why do you think this is the case?
    - Did your model overfit? Why or why not?
  

Use a Markup cell to put your name at the top of the file. Rename your file LastnameNotebook6.ipynb and submit the link to your repository to Blackboard.
